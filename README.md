Just a clean, lightweight Torrent Client with a TUI (Terminal User Interface).
I built this because I wanted something that looks cool and runs fast. It uses the aria2c engine under the hood, so speeds are actually good.

What can it do?

It's not just a wrapper for aria2, it has its own server-client infrastructure.

- TUI
- aria2c in order to Download Faster. Also includes a built-in Tracker Booster (auto adds public trackers to magnets to find peers faster)
- You can Drag & Drop .torrent files directly onto the osTorrent to start downloading
- Registers itself in Windows. You can directly open .torrent files with osTorrent

If yall would like to suggest something, fell free! You can do this on my Discord by opening a thread in suggestions.
